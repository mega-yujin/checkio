'''
This is the second mission in the lightbulb series. I will try to make each following task slightly more complex.
You have already learned how to count the amount of time a light bulb has been on, or how long a room has been lit.
Now let's add one more parameter - the counting start time.
This means that the light continues to turn on and off as before.
But now, as a result of the function,
I want not only to know how long there was light in the room, but how long the room was lit,
starting from a certain moment.

One more argument is added – start_watching,
and if it’s not passed, we count as in the previous version of the program for the entire period.

Input:  Two arguments and only the first one is required.
        The first one is a list of datetime objects and the second one is a datetime object.

Output: A number of seconds as an integer.
